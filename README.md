# Molecule Wallet App

This simple app demonstrates how to send and recieve cryptocurrency payments using the Hydrogen Molecule API.

## Features

- Create an account and login to your application with Hydrogen-managed OAuth
- Send and recieve cryptocurrency to other users
- Access your blockchain wallet with your username or email address
- View your transactions on Etherscan block explorer

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo to your computer. Test API keys are included in the project, but you can update `config/ConfigGlobal` with your own Hydrogen API keys if you wish.
2. `npm i`
3. `npm run start`
4. _You must disable CORS in your browser for the app to run._ You can download a plugin from the chrome store, or just launch chrome with web security disabled.
   For Linux users, that command is `google-chrome --disable-web-security`. On OSX, it's `open -a Google\ Chrome --args --disable-web-security --user-data-dir`
5. Visit `localhost:3000`
